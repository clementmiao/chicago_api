Chicago Location Mapping takes data from Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook and overlays this data on a google map.

For the google map base, the code is in the gmap folder. The templatetags folder contains the basic maps that we use, and the templates folder contains the javascript code for displaying the markers and posts themselves in map.html, and the javascript for the sentiment analysis in map_sentiment.html

The data magagement files are in the social_data folder. Our website currently has posts centered around Chicago, but to get data around any lattitude, longitude point, do the following:

For Twitter:
    From the command line, navigate to the chicago_api folder and run: python manage.py shell
    Once in the shell type: from social_data.twitter import twitter
    Then type: twitter(lat, lon, radius) where lat and lng are the latitude and longitude of the desired point, and radius is the desired radius in kilometers
 
 For Instagram:
    From the command line, navigate to the chicago_api folder and run: python manage.py shell
    Once in the shell type: from social_data.insta import instagram
    Then type: instagram(lat, lon, radius) where lat and lng are the latitude and longitude of the desired point, and radius is the desired radius in kilometers
    
For Facebook:
    From the command line, navigate to the chicago_api folder and run: python manage.py shell
    Once in the shell type: from social_data.facebook import facebook
    Then type: facebook(lat, lon, radius) where lat and lng are the latitude and longitude of the desired point, and radius is the desired radius in kilometers
